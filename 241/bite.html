<p>Our 4th test Bite. Michael made a calculator that will be able to accept a list of decimal digits and returns an integer where each int of the given list represents decimal place values from first element to last.</p>

<p>He wrote the function in such a way that it only accepts positive digits in <code>range(0, 10)</code> and anything that is not raises a <code>ValueError</code> if its out of range, or a TypeError if its not an int type.</p>

<p>Some examples:<ul>
<li>[0, 4, 2, 8] => 428</li>
<li>[1, 2] => 12</li>
<li>[-3, 12] => raises ValueError</li>
<li>[3.6, 4, 1] => raises TypeError</li>
<li>['4', 5, 3, 1] => raises TypeError</li>
</ul></p>

<p>In this Bite you are tasked to write the tests for this function. Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
