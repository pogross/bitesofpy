<p>Designer Mary wants to convert her CSS from statements like <code>background-color: rgb(128, 128, 0);</code> to: <code>background-color: #808000;</code>.</p><p>Don't worry, you don't have to rewrite CSS, just complete the <code>rgb_to_hex</code> helper for her that takes a tuple of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp" target="_blank">RGB</a> (3 ints) and converts it to the corresponding hex value.</p><p>For example for Maroon you would call it like <code>rgb_to_hex((128, 0, 0))</code> and it would return the hex <code>#800000</code>.</p><p>Make sure you check that each r, g and b int is within the valid range of 0 and 255 (both included), if not raise a <code>ValueError</code>, <i>Explicit is better than implicit</i> (Zen).</p><p>Check the TESTS tab for more examples, there we check your code for 16 colors and 3 excepions. Have fun!</p>
