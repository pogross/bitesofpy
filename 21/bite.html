<p>Given the provided <code>cars</code> dictionary:</p><ol><li>Get all Jeeps</li><li>Get the first car of every manufacturer.</li><li>Get all vehicles containing the string <i>Trail</i> in their names (should work for other grep too)</li><li>Sort the models (<code>values</code>) alphabetically</li></ol><p>See the docstrings and tests for more details. Have fun!</p><p>Update 18th of Sept 2018: as concluded in the forum it is better to pass the cars dict into each function to make its scope local.</p>
