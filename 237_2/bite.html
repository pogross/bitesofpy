<p>Another real-world scenario: in this Bite you will parse a json output file with Bites scored at different dates (thanks <a href="https://mockaroo.com/" target="_blank">Mockeroo</a>). Given our ninja ranking you will return a <code>dict</code> of belts earned at (readable) dates.</p>

<p>Complete <code>get_belts</code> below which receives the json file path string. The rankings are wrapped in 2 lists: <code>SCORES</code> and <code>BELTS</code></p>

<p>Here is how it should work:<pre>
>>> from belts import get_belts
>>> with open('bite_scores1.json') as f:
...     print(f.readlines()[:5])
...
['[{"date":"10/20/2019","score":1},\n', '{"date":"1/19/2019","score":1},\n', '{"date":"8/14/2018","score":1},\n', '{"date":"10/26/2019","score":4},\n', '{"date":"3/27/2019","score":1},\n']
>>> get_belts('bite_scores1.json')
{'white': 'January 23, 2018', 'yellow': 'June 20, 2018', 'orange': 'October 07, 2018', 'green': 'April 08, 2019'}
</pre></p>

<p>Have fun and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
