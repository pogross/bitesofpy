<p>In this Bite we challenge you to make a <code>dict</code>-like object that supports attribute lookups, just like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp" target="_blank">JS objects</a>!</p> <p>Check out the docstring and tests for more info ... basically after creating an object, e.g. <code>JsObject(a=1, b=2, c=3)</code>, we can access it by both key and attribute. So in this case both <code>D['c']</code> and <code>D.c</code> would return <code>3</code>. We also test for other <code>dict</code> operations / behaviors.</p> <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: take this as an exercise of inheritance and <code>dict</code> internals, but keep in mind that it violates Zen of Python's <i>There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it</i>, so probably not something you would use in your production code use!</p> <p>Other than that, have fun and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
