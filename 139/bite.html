<p>In this Bite you are going to calculate the amount of days you are on a coding streak (consecutive days coded. You are presented with this DB table like output of date/activity/count:</p><pre>

<p>Here is what you need to do: </p><ul> <li>Complete <code>extract_dates</code> to extract <code>date</code> (not <code>datetime</code>) objects.</li> <li>Complete <code>calculate_streak</code> that takes those <code>date</code> objects and returns the streak in (<code>int</code>) days.</li> <li>Calculate back from <code>TODAY</code> that is set to <code>date(2018, 11, 12)</code>. Note that a streak can be > 0 if today or yesterday is in the date range. This is because we don't assume <i>today</i> to be over yet, so if yesterday was coded that is a valid continuation of a streak. If today was coded that counts towards the streak too of course.</li></ul><p>Have fun and keep calm and code in Python.
