<p>Continuing from where we left off in Bite 209, use the <code>docstring</code> you wrote in last Bite to add type annotations to the <code>sum_numbers</code> function.</p>

<p>Note that you will need to import one of the types from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" target="_blank"><code>typing</code> module</a>. Again no need to implement the function. It's about typing here. Have fun!</p>
