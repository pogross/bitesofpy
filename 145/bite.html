<p>The data for this challenge comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) <a href="https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt">Daily Global Historical Climatology Network</a> (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.</p> <p>Each row in the datafile corresponds to a single observation.</p> <p>The following variables are provided to you:</p> <ul> <li><strong>id</strong> : station identification code</li> <li><strong>date</strong> : date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2012-01-24 = January 24, 2012)</li> <li><strong>element</strong> : indicator of element type</li> <ul> <li>TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)</li> <li>TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)</li> </ul> <li><strong>value</strong> : data value for element (tenths of degrees C)</li> </ul> <p>For this challenge, you must:</p> <ol> <li>Familiarize yourself with the dataset, then separate the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014.</li> <li>For the 2015 data, extract any points (highs and lows), for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.</li> <li>Watch out for leap days (i.e. February 29th), it is reasonable to remove these points from the dataset for the purpose of this challenge.</li> <li>Finally, return a tuple with a namedtuple for the highest and lowest record breaking stations that include its station <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>Date</strong>, and temperature <strong>Value</strong> in Celsius.</li> </ol> <p>Complete <code>high_low_record_breakers_for_2015</code> following the instructions in its <i>docstring</i>. Also check out the tests that have to pass.</p> <p>The data you have been given is near <strong>Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States</strong>, and the stations the data comes from are shown on the map below:<br><br> <img src="http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/pcc/stations.png" alt="Station Locations"> </p><p><strong>Note</strong> that our <code>pandas</code> Bites currently run on <strong>Python 3.6</strong>.</p>
