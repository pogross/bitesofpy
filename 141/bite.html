<p>Complete the <code>get_dates</code> method given the following:</p><ul><li>a listing of date strings in unknown date format and</li><li>an <code>enum</code> class which contains allowed/supported date formats</li></ul><p>Although the following assignment text is wordy, once you will see test cases the task definition will become clearer.</p><p>The <code>get_dates</code> method will return a list of date strings in the format <i>yyyy-mm-dd</i>.</p><p>The date format of input date strings will be inferred based on the most prevalent allowed date format of items in the list. Allowed/supported date formats are defined in an <code>enum</code> class.</p><p>The most prevalent allowed date format of items must represent a single most frequent date format. If there are two most frequent formats with the same frequency raise a (custom) <code>InfDateFmtError</code> exception.</p><p>Items in an input list can be in any format no matter whether or not this format is listed in the DateFormat <code>enum</code> class. Items can be even values which cannot represent a date at all. Those items are nonparsable. If the frequency of nonparsable elements is higher than the frequency of other allowed date formats (counted individually for each format) raise a custom <code>InfDateFmtError</code> exception.</p><p>Once you have the most prevalent date format, parse dates in an input list and return them as a list of strings in the format <i>yyyy-mm-dd</i>.</p><p>Dates which are not parsable replace with the string <i>Invalid</i>.</p><p><strong>Important note</strong>: the list of allowed/supported date formats is supposed to be stored in the <code>DateFormat enum</code> class only. The <code>DateFormat enum</code> class is subject of change and this change is not under your control.</p><p>As a hint, you are provided with a helper method <code>_maybe_DFs</code> which shows how to work with the <code>DateFormat enum</code> class.</p><p>This assignment introduces a very simple date format inferrer.
