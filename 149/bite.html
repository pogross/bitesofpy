<p>Here is a list of words Jacob is trying to sort: <pre>
>>> words = "It's almost Holidays and PyBites wishes You a Merry Christmas and a Happy 2019".split()
>>> sorted(words)
['2019', 'Christmas', 'Happy', 'Holidays', "It's", 'Merry', 'PyBites', 'You', 'a', 'a', 'almost', 'and', 'and', 'wishes']
</pre></p><p>Hmm ... ideally he'd like to sort them case insensitively and numbers last. Could you
complete the function below to do this for him? So the result would be: <pre>
['a', 'a', 'almost', 'and', 'and', 'Christmas', 'Happy', 'Holidays', "It's", 'Merry', 'PyBites', 'wishes', 'You', '2019']
</pre></p><p>By the way, you can submit ideas/needs/wishes for Bites <a href="https://codechalleng.es/bites">at the bottom of our Bites homepage</a> where you'll find a form for each Bite level. Cheers!</p><p>See you in the next Bite and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
