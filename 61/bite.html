<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cartamundi-108332928-Patrol-Happy-Families/dp/B01N1I89LX/ref=sr_1_11?s=kids&ie=UTF8&qid=1521329791&sr=1-11&refinements=p_n_featured_character_browse-bin%3A4773662031" target="_blank">Paw Patrol card deck</a> consists of 32 cards ranging A1-A2..B1-B2..C..G..H3-H4. 8 of these cards have an action associated: 2x <i>draw_card</i>, 2x <i>play_again</i>, 2x <i>interchange_cards</i>, 2x <i>change_turn_direction</i> which are defined in <code>ACTIONS</code>. So for each 4 cards one gets an action assigned. For this exercise you will assign them randomly. For this Bite complete <code>create_paw_deck</code> generating the deck.</p><p>To make it a bit more challenging it will receive an input argument <code>n</code> which determines the letters used in the deck: </p><ul><li>the default is 8 letters (card range A1-H4), </li><li>n=16 would give you card range A1..P4, </li><li>n=26 gives you card range A1..Z4, </li><li>if n > 26 raise a <code>ValueError</code>.</li><li>as you see the number part of the card is always 1..4 (<code>NUMBERS</code>).</li></ul><p>The function returns a list of <code>PawCard namedtuple</code> objects. Make sure that the right amount of actions get assigned to the cards (again the ratio = 1/4) and that they are randomly distributed. The tests check for this.</p><p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
