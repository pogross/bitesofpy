<p>Write a generator that returns special dates for PyBites: </p><ol><li>Every year mark counting from <code>PYBITES_BORN</code> date</li><li>Every 100 days mark counting from <code>PYBITES_BORN</code></li></ol><p>See the tests for more details how your code will be tested: as this is a beginner's challenge we only calculate a few years ahead, leaving the next leap year (2020) out of this challenge.</p><p>We will revisit this in an intermediate challenge. Have fun!</p>
