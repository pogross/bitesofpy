<p>Here is another fun regex exercise for you: it's easy to split text by newline using <code>splitlines</code>. Now try to split text by sentence.</p><p>Yes libraries like <code>nltk</code> makes this easy, but in this Bite you will do it with pure standard library and probably some regex.</p><p>We even learned a regex construct we had not used before. (Hint or maybe not. Maybe you know other ways to solve it!)</p> <p>Keep calm and code in Python!</p>
