<p>In this Bite you implement a <code>Game</code> class to perform a number guessing game. It lets a user do a max of 5 guesses of a secret number between 1 and 20 randomly defined by the class.</p><p>Note you have to account for invalid inputs: raise a <code>ValueError</code> if a user hits Enter (nothing entered), a non-numeric value, a number that is not in the 1-20 range, or guesses the same number again. See the template code below ... (<i>Advanced</i> Bite,
 not giving away too much!)</p><p>The tests run through a lose scenario as well. Note they mock out the <code>input</code> builtin to test this. And you will be tested on <i>stdout</i> too so use <code>print</code> statements in addition to return values. <a href="http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/pcc/guess.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is how the program would work from the command line.</p><p>Good luck, have fun and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
