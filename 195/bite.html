<p>In this Bite you are going to use <code>sqlite3</code>! We loaded some NBA data into a <i>players</i> DB table: <img class="flex" src="http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/pcc/nba-data-sample.png" alt="a view of the data"></p><p>Complete the 4 functions after the <i>you code</i> comment, following thier docstrings. You need to use different <code>SQL</code> queries to get the results.</p><p>Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
