<p>In this Bite you parse <code>social_platforms</code> below into a dict of <code>Validator namedtuples</code>. For each social network you should extract a <i>range</i> and <i>re.compile</i> object.</p><p>With the data parsed complete <code>validate_username</code> that validates a username against a social network of choice (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit here).</p><p>The regex might make this a bit more advanced, but as it's an advanced Bite we hope you can draw from the docstrings and tests. Enjoy and keep learning more Python!</p>
