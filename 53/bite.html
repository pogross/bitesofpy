<p>You run a news site and you got feedback that people read more if articles are printed in 2 or more columns instead of long walls of text.</p><p>Oh no! There are 200 articles in the database that need to be reformatted!</p><p>The good news though is that you know Python so you decide to come up with a nice function to do this tedious work for you.</p><p>And that's where our Bite comes in: complete <code>text_to_columns</code> which takes a text and splits it into columns (<code>COL_WIDTH</code> is set to 20).</p><p>The amount of <strong>double newlines (\n\n)</strong> in the text decides how many columns there will be so we can assume you are delivered the text in this preformatted way.</p><p>It's best to show you some examples how this would work, see <a href="http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/pcc/text2cols.html" target="_blank">the examples here</a> (these are also used in the <i>TESTS</i> tab).</p><p>Get to know the the standard library ... we reckon you probably want to leverage at least 2 modules for this. As this is an Advanced Bite we leave it at that. Good luck and have fun!</p>
