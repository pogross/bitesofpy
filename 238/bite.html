<p>Our first Test Bite! The concept is simple: to pass a Test Bite, you write tests for the program under the "Code to Test" tab. We run <a href="https://pypi.org/project/MutPy/" target="_blank">MutPy</a> against your code to see if your tests are strong enough.</p>

<p>To kick this off we have you write some tests for <code>fib</code> which generates a Fibonacci sequence. Good luck and let us know if you have any feedback.</p>
