<p>In this Bite you are going to print a chessboard to stdout (use <code>print</code>).</p><p>Complete <code>create_chessboard</code> that takes an optional argument <code>size</code> which sets the dimensions of the board (or grid).</p><p>This is how it should work:<pre>
>>> from chessboard import create_chessboard
>>> create_chessboard(2)
 #
#

>>> create_chessboard(4)
 # #
# #
 # #
# #

>>> create_chessboard(8)
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
