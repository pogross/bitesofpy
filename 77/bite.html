<p>You want to find people who have as much exposure to different cultures as yourself.</p><p>Complete the <code>uncommon_cities</code> helper that takes the cities you have visited (<code>my_cities</code>) and the cities the other person has visited (<code>other_cities</code>) and returns the number of cities that both sequences do NOT have in common.</p><p>So given [A B C] and [B C D] it should return 2 because only A and D are different.</p><p>You can loop through both sequences but maybe there is a more concise way to do it?</p>
