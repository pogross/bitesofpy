<p>This is a simple logging exercise. The <code>logging</code> module is very useful and is part of the standard library; unfortunately it is often neglected by new learners.</p><p>You are to take flesh out the <code>log_it()</code> function so that it will log to any LOG LEVEL and with any message passed to it. You will need to create <code>global</code>variables for each of the log levels, since those will be imported into the tests for testing.</p><p>LOG LEVELS: <ul> <li>DEBUG</li> <li>INFO</li> <li>WARNING</li> <li>ERROR</li> <li>CRITICAL</li> </ul></p><p>By default, all log messages are sent to the root logger, but for this bite you will have to give it the name of <strong>pybites_logger</strong>.</p><p>You should breeze through this one!</p><hr><p>Round of applause for <a href="https://twitter.com/clamytoe" target="_blank">@clamytoe</a> for delivering this Bite.</p>
