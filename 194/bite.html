<p>In this Bite you will learn about <strong>memoization</strong>: <i>In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">source</a>).</p><p>In Python you can implement this technique using the <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache" target="_blank">functools.lru_cache</a></code> decorator.</p><p>First write a simple fibonacci sequence calculator called <code>cached_fib</code>. It takes an argument n and returns the sum of the sequence.</p><p>The first test checks you return the correct result.</p><p>Next you speed it up using <code>@lru_cache</code>. The second test checks if your implementation is indeed faster than a classic fibonacci we wrote. As the fibonacci code is part of the spec we've hidden the tests to not give away too much.</p><p>Good luck and remember: keep calm and code in Python!</p><hr><p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/clamytoe" target="_blank">@clamytoe</a> for teaming up to deliver you this Bite.</p>
