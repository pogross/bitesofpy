<p>Write a simple generator that counts from 100 to 1. It can just return the <code>int</code>s one by one, no fancy formatting, just focus on the basic mechanics of generators. Remember that going beyond <code>1</code> it would trigger a <code>StopIteration</code> exception.</p><p>Here is how it works: <pre>
>>> from countdown import countdown
>>> cd = countdown()
>>> next(cd)
100
>>> next(cd)
99
>>> next(cd)
98
>>> next(cd)
97
...
... 95 calls more
...
>>> next(cd)
1
>>> next(cd)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
</pre></p><p>Good luck, have fun and keep it Python!</p>
