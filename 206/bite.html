<p>Three old friends Bob, Mary, and Alice meet at PyCon and decide to go out to dinner together. They have a wonderful time discussing lambda calculus and laughing about <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/" target="_blank"><code>import antigravity</code></a>.</p> <p>At the end of the meal, being such good friends they decide to split the check "evenly" 3 ways.</p> <p>Given an item total add tax (based on the given tax rate) and a tip (applied post-tax) producing a grand total. Next, split the grand total amount as evenly as possible amongst the friends. The sum of the per person split should be equivalent to the grand total.</p> <hr /> <h3>Tasks</h3> <p>Complete <code>check_split(item_total, tax_rate, tip, people)</code>, see the docstring for input parameters and expected return values.</p> <p>Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
