<p>Complete the program below to create a little search command line app to search the PyBites blog on tags. It uses feedparser to pull in the feed (static copy to have the same results over time), and the search should support AND / OR searches. As this is an Advanced Bite not too much hand-holding, however we have added docstrings with some guidance. You can see an example run <a href="https://bites-data.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/search.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
