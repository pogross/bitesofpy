<p>In this Bite you are presented with 3 dictionaries. Complete <code>get_person_age</code> that takes a <code>name</code> as argument and returns the age if in any of the 3 dictionaries. The lookup should be case insensitive, so <i>tim</i>, <i>Tim</i> and <i>tiM</i> should all yield <i>30</i>. If not in any of the dictionaries, return <code>Not found</code>.</p><p>Note that some persons are in 2 of the 3 dictionaries. In that case return the age of the last dictionaries (so <code>group3</code> takes precedence over  <code>group2</code> and <code>group2</code> takes precedence over <code>group1</code>). Check out the standard library ... :) - have fun!</p>
