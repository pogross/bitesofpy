<p>It's time for some type hinting!</p> <p>For this bite, you have been provided a very simple <code>Employee</code> class object. I was going to have you complete it yourself but since this bite is all about type hinting you have been given some working code. Too easy, you say?  </p> <h3>Tasks to complete:</h3> <p>Just add type hinting to the code. The tests have been hidden in order to encourage you to learn.</p> <h3>Final Note</h3> <p>Feel free to completely rewrite the class, it doesn't have to stay the way it is.</p> <p>Have fun!</p>
