<p>Check red blood cell compatibility between donor and recipient.  </p> <p>For simplicity, only eight basic types of blood are considered.</p> <p>The input of blood type can be in the form of:  </p> <ul> <li>Bloodtype enumeration</li> <li>An integer value between 0 and 7</li> <li>Textual representation  e.g. "0-", "B+", "AB+", ...</li> </ul> <hr /> <p>There are 8 basic blood types based on presence or absence of three antigens: A, B, and Rh-D.  </p> <ul> <li>0- no antigens  </li> <li>0+ Rh-D antigen  </li> <li>A- antigen A  </li> <li>A+ antigen A and Rh-D  </li> <li>B- antigen B  </li> <li>B+ antigen B and Rh-D  </li> <li>AB- antigen A and B  </li> <li>AB+ all 3 antigens (A, B, Rh-D)  </li> </ul> <hr /> <p>General rule:</p> <h3 id="anindividualwhodoesnothaveacertainantigencannotreceiveabloodfromsomeonewhohasthatantigen">An individual who does not have a certain antigen cannot receive a blood from someone who has that antigen.</h3> <p><em>Blood group 0</em> individuals do not have A or B antigens.  Therefore, a group 0 individual can receive blood only from a group 0 individual, but can donate blood to individual with types A, B, 0 or AB.  </p> <p><em>Blood group A</em> individuals have the A antigen. Therefore, a group A individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups A or 0, and can donate blood to individuals with type A or AB.  </p> <p><em>Blood group B</em> individuals have the B antigen. Therefore, a group B individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups B or 0, and can donate blood to individuals with type B or AB.  </p> <p><em>Blood group AB</em> individuals have both A and B antigens. Therefore, an individual with type AB blood can receive blood from AB0, but cannot donate blood to any group other than AB.  </p> <p><em>Rh-D negative</em> individuals do not have Rh-D antigen. Therefore, Rh-D negative can receive blood only from other Rh-D negative individuals.</p> <p><em>Rh-D positive</em> individuals have Rh-D antigen. Therefore, Rh-D positive individual can receive blood from both Rh-D negative or positive individuals.</p> <p>Individuals with 0- are universal donors. Individuals with AB+ are universal recipients.</p> <p>The rules described are general.
