<p>Iterate over the given names and countries lists. In each loop print the value of each and also the counter of the loop (starting at 1).</p><p>Here is the output you need to deliver:<pre>
1. Julian     Australia
2. Bob        Spain
3. PyBites    Global
4. Dante      Argentina
5. Martin     USA
6. Rodolfo    Mexico
</pre></p><p>The 2nd column should have a fixed width of 11 chars, so between <i>Julian</i> and <i>Australia</i> there are 5 spaces, between <i>Bob</i> and <i>Spain</i>, there are 8. This column should also be aligned to the left.</p><p>Ideally you use only one for loop, but that is not a requirement. Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
