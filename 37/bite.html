<p>Although you have to be careful using recursion it is one of those concepts you want to at least understand. It's also commonly used in coding interviews :)</p><p>In this beginner Bite we let you rewrite a simple countdown for loop using <i>recursion</i>. See <code>countdown_for</code> below, it produces the following output:</p><pre>$ python countdown.py
10

</pre><p>You will be tested on having the same output, making it work with another start value, and of course if you used recursion. Have fun!</p>
