<p>Imagine you built PyBites' new translation feature. You managed to successfully get translated text for a Bite, but there's a problem: the Python code inside the HTML <code>code</code> and <code>pre</code> tags gets translated too (yes, this actually happened to us!). Nobody ever said developer life was going to be easy right? (chuckle)</p>

<p>As we code in English, we require all code snippets to be in English even if the overall Bite description is being translated to another language.</p>

<p>Luckily, by now, you've mastered some text manipulation and regex skills (this is an advanced Bite after all) so you will write some code to fix this for all future translation calls.</p>

<p>Here is a small example (we test 3 different ones in the associated tests):</p>

<p>Original English Bite text:</p>

<p>Translator output which translated everything, description and code, to Russian:</p>

<p><img src="http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/pcc/trans-brute-force.png" alt="result of translator call"></p>

<p>You will take both output instances and produce the desired output: the description is in Russian while the code content in the <code>code</code> and <code>pre</code> tags is left intact (English):</p>

<p>Good luck and keep calm and code in Python.</p>
