<p>Complete the function below simulating Unix' <code>tail</code>, for example: <pre>$ tail -3 test_tail.py
# byte to str conversion and strip off last line's newline char
expected = [line.decode("utf-8") for line in lines]
assert tail(f.name, 10) == expected
</pre></p><p>Complete the function below which receives (absolute) <code>filepath</code> and <code>n</code> lines to filter from the end which is returned in a list.</p><p>For example, if we call it on a file - stored in <code>filepath</code> - with this content:<pre>Hello world!
We hope that you are learning a lot of Python.
Have fun with our Bites of Py.
Keep calm and code in Python!
Become a PyBites ninja!
</pre>... and give it <code>n</code> of 2 (= calling it as: <code>tail(filepath, 2)</code>), it should return this: <pre>['Keep calm and code in Python!',
 'Become a PyBites ninja!']
</pre> (note: newlines are stripped off)</p><p>Have fun and let us know if you have any questions ...</p>
